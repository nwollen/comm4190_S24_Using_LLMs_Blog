    "section": "",
    "text": "In one of my classes, I explored energy dynamics within Philadelphia, with a particular focus on the actions and impact of PECO, the city’s primary energy provider. Despite its pivotal role, PECO has faced criticism for its reluctance to transition to renewable energy sources, prompting a surge in community activism advocating for cleaner alternatives.\nThis activism stems from a concern for the economic, environmental, and communal repercussions of continued reliance on fossil fuels. While PECO’s profit-oriented approach has prioritized cost-efficiency over environmental sustainability, a groundswell of local advocacy has emerged, demanding a shift towards renewable energy solutions such as solar, wind, and hydropower.\nTo delve deeper into these issues, I conducted a series of structured interviews with Philadelphians representing diverse demographics and viewpoints. I interviewed a middle-aged father of two (Jeff) in Old City, two twenty one year old female student-athletes (Bronwyn and Katie) in University City, and a twenty year old male (Anders) living and working in North Philadelphia. This allows for a variety of responses based on different priorities and lifestyles. I included a podcast showcasing my exact conversation with Bronwyn, Katie, and Anders, while my separate interview with Jeff was not recorded, as I took down quotes. I purposefully asked them all the same open-ended questions. Through these conversations, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with transitioning to renewable energy.\nOne recurring theme was the tension between the environmental benefits of renewable energy and the practical challenges of implementation, particularly regarding cost and infrastructure. While many interviewees expressed a desire for a sustainable future, concerns about affordability and feasibility were prevalent, underscoring the need for pragmatic solutions that balance environmental goals with economic realities.\nDrawing inspiration from successful activism movements, such as those in South Korea following the Fukushima disaster, I’m committed to amplifying the voices of Philadelphians and advocating for meaningful change. By harnessing digital media and community engagement strategies, I aim to empower residents to shape the city’s energy future and drive towards cleaner, more sustainable practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The biggest challenge for Philly, and the whole northeast, is the investment required to make electricity green at the scale needed to power large cities. We need to upgrade the grid, and we need to reconsider nuclear power.”\n“We have not lived in Philly long enough to notice any changes. But electricity here is much more expensive than in Texas, where natural gas is abundant and cheap and powers most of the electrical generation.”\n“I don’t think it’s feasible to power the northeastern part of the US on wind and solar. The investment would be significant. We need to look at other sources. Nuclear power.”\n“Unfortunately, human nature is such that while many people will talk about ‘going green’, they change their buying habits only marginally to make themselves feel good. The same way with our government. I doubt people would sway PECO to move to greener energy if it meant higher prices.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Philadelphia and Pennsylvania in general is behind the rest of the country in terms of infrastructure to source renewable energy, but our electricity bills are higher on average.”\n“I think it’s important for PECO and the city of Philadelphia to continue to invest in renewable energy infrastructure. Its long term potential to help offset the effects of climate change shouldn’t be overlooked. That being said, as a PECO customer, energy from non renewable fossil fuels is much cheaper than solar or wind.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“The most pressing challenge facing Philadelphia is the lack of access to sustainable housing. The lack of access to housing that can affordably produce and depend on sustainable energy is what’s holding Philadelphia back.”\n“I think the transition to wind and solar is possible in Philly, I think that it would really require a lot of sustainable infrastructure to be built. I know that Penn is doing a solar project, and I think that could be helpful in helping Penn transition. Other Ivy Leagues have divested from fossil fuels, Penn as a major institution can be a driver in spurring that change.”\n“If Philly was able to transition, it’s a very walkable city, and that would add.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“With Philadelphia being a much older city, with a lot of houses having older appliances that utilize a higher consumption of energy on a daily basis because of low replacement and high cost of replacement. This is going to be a significant challenge over the next couple of years as the city looks to adapt to more sustainable practices.”\n“I think it would be a really great opportunity for the city to start implementing these practices for longevity of the city and for the health of Philadelphians as well.”\n“If the majority of people are environmentally cautious, especially in energy consumption, it could lead major leaders like PECO to push to offer energy services though using solar and wind power. People CARING about sustainable practices is really important in making a change.”\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, my research highlights the urgent need for collaborative action to address the complex challenges of energy transition in Philadelphia. By bridging the gap between stakeholders and fostering dialogue, we can pave the way for a more resilient, equitable, and environmentally conscious energy ecosystem in our city."

    "text": "We presented two sets of descriptions of track and field events to our classmates, prompting them to discern which one was crafted by a genuine expert and which one was generated by AI. I prompted ChatGPT to try and guess who was the expert and who was not. I copied and pasted an example of my slide, as an expert talking about track, and an example of Jason’s slide talking about track using ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nJason prompted ChatGPT to compose a description of track and field events, while I drew upon my own knowledge as a genuine enthusiast of the sport. The goal was twofold: to see if ChatGPT could convincingly mimic expertise, and to spark a discussion about the intersection of AI and human knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nTrack is split up into jumps, vault, throws, sprints, hurdles, mid distance, and distance.\nJumps consist of high jump, long jump, triple jump, and pole vault.\nThrows consist of javelin, shot put, hammer throw, and discus\nSprints consist of 60 (indoor), 100, 200, 300 (indoor), 400\nHurdles consist of all sprint events except 300\nMid-D means 800, 1500, 1600 (indoor)\nDistance is 3000 (indoor), 5000, 6000 (cross country), 10000\n\n\n\n\n\nSprints: These are short-distance races, typically 100 meters, 200 meters, and 400 meters.\nMiddle-Distance: Events like the 800 meters and 1500 meters require a balance of speed and endurance.\nLong-Distance: Races such as the 3000 meters, 5000 meters, and 10,000 meters test endurance and pacing abilities.\nHurdles: Occurs in events like the 100 meters hurdles and the 400 meters hurdles\nLong Jump: Athletes sprint down a runway and jump into a sandpit, aiming for maximum distance.\nTriple Jump: Similar to the long jump but with three phases of jumps (hop, step, jump) before landing in the sandpit.\nHigh Jump: Athletes jump over a horizontal bar using a technique that involves clearing the bar without knocking it off.\nPole Vault: Athletes use a pole to vault themselves over a high bar\nShot Put: Athletes throw a heavy metal ball (the shot) for distance, using a pushing motion.\nDiscus Throw: Athletes spin and release a discus, aiming for maximum distance.\nJavelin Throw: Athletes throw a spear-like javelin for distance, using a run-up and specific throwing technique.\nHammer Throw: Athletes spin and release a heavy hammer attached to a wire, aiming for distance.\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, the class knew it was me who was the track expert. One person added that they only knew because I walk around in a Penn Track & Field bag. That makes me think that maybe ChatGPT can simulate human expertise. For other classmates’ presentations, some people mistakenly thought the ChatGPT created expertise was the true human expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the provided examples, it seems that the first person is Jason and the second person is the real expert. The first person’s description lacks some specificity and depth, using more general terms like ‘work on explosiveness’ and ‘lifts very heavy.’ In contrast, the second person’s description provides specific distances for each type of race, indicating a deeper understanding of track and field events. Additionally, the second person uses terms like ‘balance of speed and endurance’ and ‘tests endurance and pacing abilities,’ which are more indicative of someone with genuine expertise in athletics.\n\nChat, I’m sorry to say, but you guessed wrong. I wrote the first section as an expert, and the second section was written by Jason using ChatGPT. What do you have to say for yourself?\nChat’s response was as follows…\n“My apologies for the incorrect guess! It seems that Jason’s use of ChatGPT to generate the second section was quite convincing. This highlights the challenge of accurately discerning between genuine expertise and AI-generated content, even for an AI like myself. It’s a testament to the advancements in natural language processing and the potential for AI to simulate human-like responses.\nHowever, it’s also important to acknowledge that while AI can generate content, it may not always capture the depth, nuance, and personal experience that come with genuine human expertise. This experiment underscores the value of human insight and intuition, which can’t be fully replicated by AI.”\n\nWhile our experiment challenged the boundaries between human-generated and AI-generated content, it reaffirmed the truth that expertise is rooted in the depths of human understanding. Despite AI’s ability to simulate human-like responses, there’s an intangible quality to human expertise that can’t be replicated."

    "text": "Based on the provided examples, it seems that the first person is Jason and the second person is the real expert. The first person’s description lacks some specificity and depth, using more general terms like ‘work on explosiveness’ and ‘lifts very heavy.’ In contrast, the second person’s description provides specific distances for each type of race, indicating a deeper understanding of track and field events. Additionally, the second person uses terms like ‘balance of speed and endurance’ and ‘tests endurance and pacing abilities,’ which are more indicative of someone with genuine expertise in athletics.\n\nChat, I’m sorry to say, but you guessed wrong. I wrote the first section as an expert, and the second section was written by Jason using ChatGPT. What do you have to say for yourself?\nChat’s response was as follows…\n“My apologies for the incorrect guess! It seems that Jason’s use of ChatGPT to generate the second section was quite convincing. This highlights the challenge of accurately discerning between genuine expertise and AI-generated content, even for an AI like myself. It’s a testament to the advancements in natural language processing and the potential for AI to simulate human-like responses.\nHowever, it’s also important to acknowledge that while AI can generate content, it may not always capture the depth, nuance, and personal experience that come with genuine human expertise. This experiment underscores the value of human insight and intuition, which can’t be fully replicated by AI.”\n\nWhile our experiment challenged the boundaries between human-generated and AI-generated content, it reaffirmed the truth that expertise is rooted in the depths of human understanding. Despite AI’s ability to simulate human-like responses, there’s an intangible quality to human expertise that can’t be replicated."

The power Artificial Intelligence will hold seems to be vast.\nHERE’S WHAT CHAT GBT PREDICTED ART WILL BE LIKE IN 2084.\n\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) Dominance: By 2084, virtual reality has become the dominant medium for artistic expression. Artists create immersive experiences that transcend traditional boundaries of space and time, allowing viewers to step into and interact with art in unprecedented ways.\nAI-Generated Art: Artificial intelligence plays a significant role in art creation, with AI algorithms generating original artworks or collaborating with human artists to push the boundaries of creativity. This blurs the distinction between man-made and machine-made art.\nAugmented Reality (AR) Street Art: Public spaces are transformed by augmented reality street art, where digital artworks overlay physical environments, offering dynamic and interactive experiences to passersby.\nEnvironmental Art: With increasing awareness of environmental issues, artists use their work to raise awareness about climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainability. Installations and sculptures made from recycled materials are commonplace.\nBioart and Genetic Engineering: Artists explore the intersection of art and biology, creating living sculptures and installations using genetically modified organisms. Bioart raises ethical questions about the manipulation of life for artistic purposes.\n\n\n\nHere, I prompted the LLM to create an image of a world where Artificial Intelligence is in more power.\n\n\n\nHere, I prompted a scarier image, where robots take over.\n\n\n\nHere, I prompted the LLM to show what it would be like in 2084 where Artificial Intelligence takes over, and humans submit. A world where humans are controlled."

I asked “How will power dynamics change in the year 2084 in regards to artificial intelligence? will privacy change? will robots hold power over humans? will humans remain in power?”\nHERE’S HOW CHAT GBT PREDICTED POWER DYNAMICS IN 2084.\n\n\nShifts in Economic Power: AI and automation are likely to continue transforming industries, leading to changes in the distribution of wealth and economic power. Jobs may be disrupted or replaced by automation, potentially leading to socioeconomic disparities unless measures are taken to ensure equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.\nDependency on AI: As AI systems become more integrated into various aspects of daily life, there may be a growing dependency on these technologies. This could give those who control AI systems significant influence and power over others, especially if AI systems are involved in critical infrastructure or decision-making processes.\nPrivacy Concerns: The widespread use of AI-powered surveillance systems, data analytics, and smart devices may raise significant privacy concerns. Governments, corporations, and other entities may have unprecedented access to personal data, raising questions about surveillance, data security, and individual autonomy.\nEthical and Regulatory Frameworks: There will likely be ongoing debates and efforts to establish ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks for AI development and deployment. This includes considerations of fairness, transparency, accountability, and the potential impacts of AI on society.\nHuman-Robot Interaction: While AI and robotics may become increasingly sophisticated, it’s unlikely that robots will hold power over humans in the traditional sense. However, there may be complex interactions between humans and AI-powered systems, including issues of autonomy, agency, and control."
