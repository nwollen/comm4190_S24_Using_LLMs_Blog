The power Artificial Intelligence will hold seems to be vast.\nHERE’S WHAT CHAT GBT PREDICTED ART WILL BE LIKE IN 2084.\n\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) Dominance: By 2084, virtual reality has become the dominant medium for artistic expression. Artists create immersive experiences that transcend traditional boundaries of space and time, allowing viewers to step into and interact with art in unprecedented ways.\nAI-Generated Art: Artificial intelligence plays a significant role in art creation, with AI algorithms generating original artworks or collaborating with human artists to push the boundaries of creativity. This blurs the distinction between man-made and machine-made art.\nAugmented Reality (AR) Street Art: Public spaces are transformed by augmented reality street art, where digital artworks overlay physical environments, offering dynamic and interactive experiences to passersby.\nEnvironmental Art: With increasing awareness of environmental issues, artists use their work to raise awareness about climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainability. Installations and sculptures made from recycled materials are commonplace.\nBioart and Genetic Engineering: Artists explore the intersection of art and biology, creating living sculptures and installations using genetically modified organisms. Bioart raises ethical questions about the manipulation of life for artistic purposes.\n\n\n\nHere, I prompted the LLM to create an image of a world where Artificial Intelligence is in more power.\n\n\n\nHere, I prompted a scarier image, where robots take over.\n\n\n\nHere, I prompted the LLM to show what it would be like in 2084 where Artificial Intelligence takes over, and humans submit. A world where humans are controlled."

I asked “How will power dynamics change in the year 2084 in regards to artificial intelligence? will privacy change? will robots hold power over humans? will humans remain in power?”\nHERE’S HOW CHAT GBT PREDICTED POWER DYNAMICS IN 2084.\n\n\nShifts in Economic Power: AI and automation are likely to continue transforming industries, leading to changes in the distribution of wealth and economic power. Jobs may be disrupted or replaced by automation, potentially leading to socioeconomic disparities unless measures are taken to ensure equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.\nDependency on AI: As AI systems become more integrated into various aspects of daily life, there may be a growing dependency on these technologies. This could give those who control AI systems significant influence and power over others, especially if AI systems are involved in critical infrastructure or decision-making processes.\nPrivacy Concerns: The widespread use of AI-powered surveillance systems, data analytics, and smart devices may raise significant privacy concerns. Governments, corporations, and other entities may have unprecedented access to personal data, raising questions about surveillance, data security, and individual autonomy.\nEthical and Regulatory Frameworks: There will likely be ongoing debates and efforts to establish ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks for AI development and deployment. This includes considerations of fairness, transparency, accountability, and the potential impacts of AI on society.\nHuman-Robot Interaction: While AI and robotics may become increasingly sophisticated, it’s unlikely that robots will hold power over humans in the traditional sense. However, there may be complex interactions between humans and AI-powered systems, including issues of autonomy, agency, and control."

Infrastructure improvements focus on sustainability and resilience, with investments in renewable energy, efficient public transportation, and climate adaptation measures. The lakefront undergoes revitalization efforts, with enhanced public spaces, recreational amenities, and green infrastructure projects to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect against rising water levels. 40 years:\nAdvances in architecture and construction technology lead to the development of innovative, eco-friendly buildings that blend seamlessly with the surrounding landscape. The skyline evolves into a mix of futuristic skyscrapers and historic landmarks, preserving the city’s heritage while embracing modernity. Infrastructure upgrades prioritize smart city initiatives, with interconnected systems for transportation, energy, and communication enhancing efficiency and sustainability. 60 years:\nThe cityscape undergoes a transformation as urban planning initiatives prioritize green spaces, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, and mixed-use developments. Sustainable infrastructure becomes the norm, with renewable energy sources powering the city and green building practices reducing environmental impact. The lakefront becomes a focal point for recreation, culture, and community engagement, with vibrant waterfront districts and resilient infrastructure protecting against natural disasters. 80 years:\nThe skyline reaches new heights as super-tall skyscrapers redefine the city’s silhouette, symbolizing its status as a global hub for innovation and commerce. Urban design principles prioritize inclusivity and accessibility, with equitable access to resources and amenities shaping the built environment. The lakefront remains a cherished asset, with ongoing efforts to preserve biodiversity, enhance water quality, and promote sustainable development along the waterfront. 100+ years:\nThe city’s infrastructure reflects a legacy of sustainable planning and stewardship, with resilient systems capable of adapting to evolving environmental challenges.

Here’s what it said…\n\nEconomic Resilience: Chicago has a diverse economy with strengths in finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and technology. However, if the city fails to adapt to shifts in global markets, technological advancements, or economic downturns, it could face challenges such as job losses, business closures, and declining tax revenue.\nInfrastructure Strain: Aging infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public transportation systems, poses a significant risk to the city’s functionality. Without adequate investment in maintenance and upgrades, Chicago could experience increased congestion, service disruptions, and decreased quality of life for residents.\nSocial Inequality: Economic disparities and social inequities persist in Chicago, affecting access to education, healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities. Failure to address these issues could lead to social unrest, crime, and further polarization within the city.\nEnvironmental Hazards: Chicago is susceptible to environmental hazards such as extreme weather events, flooding, and pollution. Failure to mitigate and adapt to these risks could result in property damage, public health crises, and displacement of vulnerable communities.\nPolitical Dysfunction: Political gridlock, corruption, and lack of effective governance can hinder the city’s ability to address pressing issues and implement long-term solutions. Without strong leadership and collaboration, Chicago may struggle to overcome its challenges and maintain public trust.\nWhile these scenarios outline potential risks, it’s important to note that cities are resilient and have a capacity for innovation and adaptation. With proactive planning, investment, and community engagement, Chicago has the potential to overcome its challenges and thrive in the face of adversity.\n\n\nThat’s less than ideal.
