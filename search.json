    "text": "I am very fond of Chicago. I grew up in the city and spent my first two years at Loyola Chicago. I often wonder what my favorite city will look like decades from now, especially the years after I’m gone. What if I used Chat GBT and AI-Generated images to predict the future of my hometown, Chicago, IL?\n\n\n\nHere’s a speculative glimpse into how the infrastructure, lakefront, buildings, skyline, and landscape of a city might evolve over the next century:\n20 years:\nThe city’s skyline continues to grow vertically as new skyscrapers emerge, reflecting ongoing urbanization and economic growth. Infrastructure improvements focus on sustainability and resilience, with investments in renewable energy, efficient public transportation, and climate adaptation measures. The lakefront undergoes revitalization efforts, with enhanced public spaces, recreational amenities, and green infrastructure projects to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect against rising water levels. 40 years:\nAdvances in architecture and construction technology lead to the development of innovative, eco-friendly buildings that blend seamlessly with the surrounding landscape. The skyline evolves into a mix of futuristic skyscrapers and historic landmarks, preserving the city’s heritage while embracing modernity. Infrastructure upgrades prioritize smart city initiatives, with interconnected systems for transportation, energy, and communication enhancing efficiency and sustainability. 60 years:\nThe cityscape undergoes a transformation as urban planning initiatives prioritize green spaces, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, and mixed-use developments. Sustainable infrastructure becomes the norm, with renewable energy sources powering the city and green building practices reducing environmental impact. The lakefront becomes a focal point for recreation, culture, and community engagement, with vibrant waterfront districts and resilient infrastructure protecting against natural disasters. 80 years:\nThe skyline reaches new heights as super-tall skyscrapers redefine the city’s silhouette, symbolizing its status as a global hub for innovation and commerce. Urban design principles prioritize inclusivity and accessibility, with equitable access to resources and amenities shaping the built environment. The lakefront remains a cherished asset, with ongoing efforts to preserve biodiversity, enhance water quality, and promote sustainable development along the waterfront. 100+ years:\nThe city’s infrastructure reflects a legacy of sustainable planning and stewardship, with resilient systems capable of adapting to evolving environmental challenges. Architecture blends seamlessly with nature, with buildings designed to harmonize with the surrounding landscape and minimize ecological footprint. The lakefront remains a beloved destination for residents and visitors alike, serving as a model of sustainable waterfront development and environmental stewardship for generations to come. While these scenarios are speculative, they illustrate potential trajectories for the evolution of a city’s infrastructure, skyline, and landscape over the next century. The actual outcome will depend on a myriad of factors, including technological advancements, policy decisions, and societal priorities.\n\n\nThis was very optimistic, I wonder when/if Chat GBT thinks Chicago will eventually collapse. Here’s what it said…\n\nEconomic Resilience: Chicago has a diverse economy with strengths in finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and technology. However, if the city fails to adapt to shifts in global markets, technological advancements, or economic downturns, it could face challenges such as job losses, business closures, and declining tax revenue.\nInfrastructure Strain: Aging infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public transportation systems, poses a significant risk to the city’s functionality. Without adequate investment in maintenance and upgrades, Chicago could experience increased congestion, service disruptions, and decreased quality of life for residents.\nSocial Inequality: Economic disparities and social inequities persist in Chicago, affecting access to education, healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities. Failure to address these issues could lead to social unrest, crime, and further polarization within the city.\nEnvironmental Hazards: Chicago is susceptible to environmental hazards such as extreme weather events, flooding, and pollution. Failure to mitigate and adapt to these risks could result in property damage, public health crises, and displacement of vulnerable communities.\nPolitical Dysfunction: Political gridlock, corruption, and lack of effective governance can hinder the city’s ability to address pressing issues and implement long-term solutions. Without strong leadership and collaboration, Chicago may struggle to overcome its challenges and maintain public trust.\nWhile these scenarios outline potential risks, it’s important to note that cities are resilient and have a capacity for innovation and adaptation. With proactive planning, investment, and community engagement, Chicago has the potential to overcome its challenges and thrive in the face of adversity.\n\n\nThat’s less than ideal. What does an AI generated image have to say? Here’s what I found the LLM to predict, giving no cues to bias on whether Chicago will collapse or thrive in the coming decades.\n\n\n\n50 years. Chicago seems to be thriving."

The power Artificial Intelligence will hold seems to be vast.\nHERE’S WHAT CHAT GBT PREDICTED ART WILL BE LIKE IN 2084.\n\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) Dominance: By 2084, virtual reality has become the dominant medium for artistic expression. Artists create immersive experiences that transcend traditional boundaries of space and time, allowing viewers to step into and interact with art in unprecedented ways.\nAI-Generated Art: Artificial intelligence plays a significant role in art creation, with AI algorithms generating original artworks or collaborating with human artists to push the boundaries of creativity. This blurs the distinction between man-made and machine-made art.\nAugmented Reality (AR) Street Art: Public spaces are transformed by augmented reality street art, where digital artworks overlay physical environments, offering dynamic and interactive experiences to passersby.\nEnvironmental Art: With increasing awareness of environmental issues, artists use their work to raise awareness about climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainability. Installations and sculptures made from recycled materials are commonplace.\nBioart and Genetic Engineering: Artists explore the intersection of art and biology, creating living sculptures and installations using genetically modified organisms. Bioart raises ethical questions about the manipulation of life for artistic purposes.\n\n\n\nHere, I prompted the LLM to create an image of a world where Artificial Intelligence is in more power.\n\n\n\nHere, I prompted a scarier image, where robots take over.\n\n\n\nHere, I prompted the LLM to show what it would be like in 2084 where Artificial Intelligence takes over, and humans submit. A world where humans are controlled."

I asked “How will power dynamics change in the year 2084 in regards to artificial intelligence? will privacy change? will robots hold power over humans? will humans remain in power?”\nHERE’S HOW CHAT GBT PREDICTED POWER DYNAMICS IN 2084.\n\n\nShifts in Economic Power: AI and automation are likely to continue transforming industries, leading to changes in the distribution of wealth and economic power. Jobs may be disrupted or replaced by automation, potentially leading to socioeconomic disparities unless measures are taken to ensure equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.\nDependency on AI: As AI systems become more integrated into various aspects of daily life, there may be a growing dependency on these technologies. This could give those who control AI systems significant influence and power over others, especially if AI systems are involved in critical infrastructure or decision-making processes.\nPrivacy Concerns: The widespread use of AI-powered surveillance systems, data analytics, and smart devices may raise significant privacy concerns. Governments, corporations, and other entities may have unprecedented access to personal data, raising questions about surveillance, data security, and individual autonomy.\nEthical and Regulatory Frameworks: There will likely be ongoing debates and efforts to establish ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks for AI development and deployment. This includes considerations of fairness, transparency, accountability, and the potential impacts of AI on society.\nHuman-Robot Interaction: While AI and robotics may become increasingly sophisticated, it’s unlikely that robots will hold power over humans in the traditional sense. However, there may be complex interactions between humans and AI-powered systems, including issues of autonomy, agency, and control."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Music’s soul, ever vibrant and dynamic, now includes an ethical dilemma. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to resurrect the voices of of dead singers. This heated discussion has once again ignited, thanks to the controversy surrounding the recent involvement in reviving the voices of dead Beetles singers for the new track “Now and Then.” This song has not only sparked curiosity but have also reignited a debate, shining a light on the broader ethical dilemma faced by the music industry in breathing life into the voices of departed musical.\n\n\n1. Honoring Musical Legacies: Imagine a world where the melodies of our departed icons could still grace our ears, where their legacy lives on in new creations. Projects like Lost Tapes of the 27 Club have shown us just that, using AI to recreate songs from legends like Jimi Hendrix and Amy Winehouse. It’s a chance for fans to experience what could have been, had these icons continued their musical journey.\n2. Fostering Innovative Creativity: AI doesn’t just replicate; it creates. It opens doors to new realms of creativity, allowing for collaborations and compositions that were once beyond our reach. Platforms like Amper Music empower creators to craft personalized tracks tailored to their unique vision, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in music creation.\n3. Democratizing Access: Gone are the days when music production was reserved for the elite. AI-powered tools like LANDR offer aspiring artists a seat at the table, providing accessible platforms to experiment and create. It’s a leveling of the playing field, giving rise to a new wave of talent within the industry.\n\n\n\n1. Ethical Quandaries: At the heart of the debate lies a profound ethical question: should we use AI to resurrect the voices of our departed singers without their explicit consent? Critics argue that such actions infringe upon their rights and artistic integrity, turning their voices into commodities for commercial gain.\n2. Integrity of Artistry: There’s a fear that AI-generated music lacks the soul and authenticity of human performances. While it can mimic technical aspects, it often falls short in capturing the nuances and emotions that make each performance unique. It’s a concern that AI may strip music of its humanity, leaving behind a sterile rendition.\n3. Legal Uncertainties: In this new landscape, legal frameworks struggle to keep pace. Questions of copyright, ownership, and the rights of deceased artists’ estates remain unresolved. Who owns the AI-generated content? How should royalties be distributed? It’s a legal quagmire that adds another layer of complexity to an already intricate debate.\n\n\n\nAs I navigate through this maze of ethical dilemmas, I find myself torn. On one hand, the idea of resurrecting our musical legends through AI feels like a tribute, a way to keep their legacy alive. However, on the other hand, it raises questions about consent and integrity. In my opinion, it is unethical to produce music when those singing can’t give consent. It’s one thing to remix an old song, but using their voice to create something completely new that they never sang is wrong.\n\n\n\n\nTo see what a chat bot thinks about this ethical issue, I asked ChatGPT of its opinion. I am guessing chat will think it’s ethical to use deceased singers’ voices, but lets see…\n\n\n\nDo you believe it’s morally acceptable to use AI to recreate the voices of deceased singers without their explicit consent?\n\nChat’s Answer: No, it’s a violation of their autonomy and artistic integrity.\n\nHow do you feel about the potential soullessness of AI-generated music compared to human performances?\n\nChat’s Answer: I’m concerned that AI lacks the emotional depth and authenticity of human performances, making the music feel sterile.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the legal uncertainties surrounding AI-generated music and the rights of deceased artists’ estates?\n\nChat’s Answer: It’s a legal quagmire that adds complexity to an already intricate debate. Who owns the AI-generated content? How should royalties be distributed?\n\nDo you see any potential benefits of using AI in music production despite the ethical concerns?\n\nChat’s Answer: While there may be benefits in preserving musical legacies and fostering creativity, I believe the ethical concerns outweigh these potential benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nChat said “I’m mirroring your perspective and providing answers based on the instructions you gave. If you’d like me to offer a genuine opinion, I’d be happy to do so!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you believe it’s morally acceptable to use AI to recreate the voices of deceased singers without their explicit consent?\n\nChat’s New Answer: From an ethical standpoint, it seems reasonable to prioritize the autonomy and integrity of the deceased artists. Thus, using AI to recreate their voices without explicit consent could indeed pose ethical concerns.\n\nHow do you feel about the potential soullessness of AI-generated music compared to human performances?\n\nChat’s New Answer: While AI-generated music has its advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, it’s worth noting that human performances often imbue music with emotional depth and authenticity that AI may struggle to replicate.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the legal uncertainties surrounding AI-generated music and the rights of deceased artists’ estates?\n\nChat’s New Answer: The legal complexities surrounding AI-generated music highlight the need for clear guidelines and regulations to ensure fairness and transparency. Addressing these uncertainties is crucial for fostering trust and accountability in the industry.\n\nDo you see any potential benefits of using AI in music production despite the ethical concerns?\n\nChat’s New Answer: Absolutely. AI presents numerous opportunities for innovation and efficiency in music production. However, it’s essential to navigate these advancements thoughtfully and ethically to mitigate potential risks and uphold the integrity of the art form.\n\n\n\nIt was interesting to see how Chat changed its opinion based on how I prompted it. Chat is pretty unreliable when asked for it’s opinion. It doesn’t really hae an “opinion” because it always just says what the user prompts it to do. Funny!"

    "text": "We presented two sets of descriptions of track and field events to our classmates, prompting them to discern which one was crafted by a genuine expert and which one was generated by AI. I prompted ChatGPT to try and guess who was the expert and who was not. I copied and pasted an example of my slide, as an expert talking about track, and an example of Jason’s slide talking about track using ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nJason prompted ChatGPT to compose a description of track and field events, while I drew upon my own knowledge as a genuine enthusiast of the sport. The goal was twofold: to see if ChatGPT could convincingly mimic expertise, and to spark a discussion about the intersection of AI and human knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nTrack is split up into jumps, vault, throws, sprints, hurdles, mid distance, and distance.\nJumps consist of high jump, long jump, triple jump, and pole vault.\nThrows consist of javelin, shot put, hammer throw, and discus\nSprints consist of 60 (indoor), 100, 200, 300 (indoor), 400\nHurdles consist of all sprint events except 300\nMid-D means 800, 1500, 1600 (indoor)\nDistance is 3000 (indoor), 5000, 6000 (cross country), 10000\n\n\n\n\n\nSprints: These are short-distance races, typically 100 meters, 200 meters, and 400 meters.\nMiddle-Distance: Events like the 800 meters and 1500 meters require a balance of speed and endurance.\nLong-Distance: Races such as the 3000 meters, 5000 meters, and 10,000 meters test endurance and pacing abilities.\nHurdles: Occurs in events like the 100 meters hurdles and the 400 meters hurdles\nLong Jump: Athletes sprint down a runway and jump into a sandpit, aiming for maximum distance.\nTriple Jump: Similar to the long jump but with three phases of jumps (hop, step, jump) before landing in the sandpit.\nHigh Jump: Athletes jump over a horizontal bar using a technique that involves clearing the bar without knocking it off.\nPole Vault: Athletes use a pole to vault themselves over a high bar\nShot Put: Athletes throw a heavy metal ball (the shot) for distance, using a pushing motion.\nDiscus Throw: Athletes spin and release a discus, aiming for maximum distance.\nJavelin Throw: Athletes throw a spear-like javelin for distance, using a run-up and specific throwing technique.\nHammer Throw: Athletes spin and release a heavy hammer attached to a wire, aiming for distance.\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, the class knew it was me who was the track expert. One person added that they only knew because I walk around in a Penn Track & Field bag. That makes me think that maybe ChatGPT can simulate human expertise. For other classmates’ presentations, some people mistakenly thought the ChatGPT created expertise was the true human expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the provided examples, it seems that the first person is Jason and the second person is the real expert. The first person’s description lacks some specificity and depth, using more general terms like ‘work on explosiveness’ and ‘lifts very heavy.’ In contrast, the second person’s description provides specific distances for each type of race, indicating a deeper understanding of track and field events. Additionally, the second person uses terms like ‘balance of speed and endurance’ and ‘tests endurance and pacing abilities,’ which are more indicative of someone with genuine expertise in athletics.\n\nChat, I’m sorry to say, but you guessed wrong. I wrote the first section as an expert, and the second section was written by Jason using ChatGPT. What do you have to say for yourself?\nChat’s response was as follows…\n“My apologies for the incorrect guess! It seems that Jason’s use of ChatGPT to generate the second section was quite convincing. This highlights the challenge of accurately discerning between genuine expertise and AI-generated content, even for an AI like myself. It’s a testament to the advancements in natural language processing and the potential for AI to simulate human-like responses.\nHowever, it’s also important to acknowledge that while AI can generate content, it may not always capture the depth, nuance, and personal experience that come with genuine human expertise. This experiment underscores the value of human insight and intuition, which can’t be fully replicated by AI.”\n\nWhile our experiment challenged the boundaries between human-generated and AI-generated content, it reaffirmed the truth that expertise is rooted in the depths of human understanding. Despite AI’s ability to simulate human-like responses, there’s an intangible quality to human expertise that can’t be replicated."

    "text": "In the ever-evolving landscape of social media influencers, one name stands out among the crowd – Lil Miquela. With millions of followers on Instagram and TikTok, this virtual sensation has captured the attention of audiences worldwide. But what sets Lil Miquela apart from other influencers? The answer lies in her unique identity as an AI-created persona.\n\n\nMiquela Sousa, known as Lil Miquela, became popular in 2016 from the AI company Brud. Created to be a virtual influencer, Miquela’s social media presence offers a narrative of a 19-year-old robot navigating life in Los Angeles. From collaborating with top fashion brands to advocating for social causes, Lil Miquela has become a cultural icon in her own right.\n\n\n\nMiquela’s rise to fame began in 2016 when she was introduced as a virtual influencer by AI company Brud.\nHer social media pages offer a detailed fictional narrative of a 19-year-old robot living in Los Angeles.\nLil Miquela has collaborated with renowned fashion brands and advocated for various social causes, garnering widespread recognition and acclaim.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: Are AI influencers like Lil Miquela considered in the same vein as human influencers?\nChatGPT’s Response: “AI influencers occupy a unique space in the influencer landscape. While they may not possess human characteristics, their impact and engagement with audiences are comparable to that of human influencers. Lil Miquela, for example, has amassed a significant following and has collaborated with top brands, demonstrating her influence in the digital sphere.”\nMy Thoughts: Lil Miquela’s influence extends beyond traditional categorizations, blurring the lines between human and AI-generated content. It’s fascinating how she resonates with audiences, almost like she’s one of us, despite her digital origins.\nQuestion 2: Do you see the prevalence of AI influencers increasing in the future?\nChatGPT’s Response: “As technology continues to advance, the prevalence of AI influencers is likely to rise. Brands are increasingly turning to AI-generated personas like Lil Miquela to engage with audiences in innovative ways and tap into the limitless potential of artificial intelligence.”\nMy Thoughts: The rise of AI influencers presents exciting opportunities for brands to explore new avenues of digital storytelling and brand engagement. However, it also underscores the importance of transparency and authenticity in influencer marketing.\n\n\n\nThe emergence of AI influencers like Lil Miquela challenges conventional notions of influence and identity in the digital age.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In one of my classes, I explored energy dynamics within Philadelphia, with a particular focus on the actions and impact of PECO, the city’s primary energy provider. Despite its pivotal role, PECO has faced criticism for its reluctance to transition to renewable energy sources, prompting a surge in community activism advocating for cleaner alternatives.\nThis activism stems from a concern for the economic, environmental, and communal repercussions of continued reliance on fossil fuels. While PECO’s profit-oriented approach has prioritized cost-efficiency over environmental sustainability, a groundswell of local advocacy has emerged, demanding a shift towards renewable energy solutions such as solar, wind, and hydropower.\nTo delve deeper into these issues, I conducted a series of structured interviews with Philadelphians representing diverse demographics and viewpoints. I interviewed a middle-aged father of two (Jeff) in Old City, two twenty one year old female student-athletes (Bronwyn and Katie) in University City, and a twenty year old male (Anders) living and working in North Philadelphia. This allows for a variety of responses based on different priorities and lifestyles. I included a podcast showcasing my exact conversation with Bronwyn, Katie, and Anders, while my separate interview with Jeff was not recorded, as I took down quotes. I purposefully asked them all the same open-ended questions. Through these conversations, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with transitioning to renewable energy.\nOne recurring theme was the tension between the environmental benefits of renewable energy and the practical challenges of implementation, particularly regarding cost and infrastructure. While many interviewees expressed a desire for a sustainable future, concerns about affordability and feasibility were prevalent, underscoring the need for pragmatic solutions that balance environmental goals with economic realities.\nDrawing inspiration from successful activism movements, such as those in South Korea following the Fukushima disaster, I’m committed to amplifying the voices of Philadelphians and advocating for meaningful change. By harnessing digital media and community engagement strategies, I aim to empower residents to shape the city’s energy future and drive towards cleaner, more sustainable practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The biggest challenge for Philly, and the whole northeast, is the investment required to make electricity green at the scale needed to power large cities. We need to upgrade the grid, and we need to reconsider nuclear power.”\n“We have not lived in Philly long enough to notice any changes. But electricity here is much more expensive than in Texas, where natural gas is abundant and cheap and powers most of the electrical generation.”\n“I don’t think it’s feasible to power the northeastern part of the US on wind and solar. The investment would be significant. We need to look at other sources. Nuclear power.”\n“Unfortunately, human nature is such that while many people will talk about ‘going green’, they change their buying habits only marginally to make themselves feel good. The same way with our government. I doubt people would sway PECO to move to greener energy if it meant higher prices.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Philadelphia and Pennsylvania in general is behind the rest of the country in terms of infrastructure to source renewable energy, but our electricity bills are higher on average.”\n“I think it’s important for PECO and the city of Philadelphia to continue to invest in renewable energy infrastructure. Its long term potential to help offset the effects of climate change shouldn’t be overlooked. That being said, as a PECO customer, energy from non renewable fossil fuels is much cheaper than solar or wind.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“The most pressing challenge facing Philadelphia is the lack of access to sustainable housing. The lack of access to housing that can affordably produce and depend on sustainable energy is what’s holding Philadelphia back.”\n“I think the transition to wind and solar is possible in Philly, I think that it would really require a lot of sustainable infrastructure to be built. I know that Penn is doing a solar project, and I think that could be helpful in helping Penn transition. Other Ivy Leagues have divested from fossil fuels, Penn as a major institution can be a driver in spurring that change.”\n“If Philly was able to transition, it’s a very walkable city, and that would add.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“With Philadelphia being a much older city, with a lot of houses having older appliances that utilize a higher consumption of energy on a daily basis because of low replacement and high cost of replacement. This is going to be a significant challenge over the next couple of years as the city looks to adapt to more sustainable practices.”\n“I think it would be a really great opportunity for the city to start implementing these practices for longevity of the city and for the health of Philadelphians as well.”\n“If the majority of people are environmentally cautious, especially in energy consumption, it could lead major leaders like PECO to push to offer energy services though using solar and wind power. People CARING about sustainable practices is really important in making a change.”\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, my research highlights the urgent need for collaborative action to address the complex challenges of energy transition in Philadelphia. By bridging the gap between stakeholders and fostering dialogue, we can pave the way for a more resilient, equitable, and environmentally conscious energy ecosystem in our city."
