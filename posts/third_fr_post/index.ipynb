    "*  PECO, Pennsylvania's largest electric and gas utility energy company, continues to prioritize profit over environmental and community costs. PECO’s impacts on the Philadelphian community are vast, with a combination of power outages, rising energy bills, and burning of fossil fuels. The community faces challenges in transitioning to clean energy due to PECO’s power and reluctance to shift its energy usage. Can Chat GBT assist in leading a revolution to solve this crisis?"
